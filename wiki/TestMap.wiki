#The roadmap for features in this software

= GA4PHP RoadMap =

GA4PHP will (hopefully) be a fully fledged authentication system that is easy to use and/or easy to add to an existing application while maintaining a high level of security.

= Upcoming Features =

  # Drop database for named functions (i.e. remove sqlite and get/put data via functions passed in at init time).
  # forcing ssl
  # QRCode generator entirely in PHP (yeah right...)
  # mOTP and support for non-google authenticators (including hardware ones).
  # third party auth? i.e. website one is the auth provider for website 2 as a service
  # integration plugins for some common applications (mediawiki, drupal, wordpress..)
