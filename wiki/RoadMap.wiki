= GA4PHP RoadMap =

GA4PHP will (hopefully) be a fully fledged authentication system that is easy to use and/or easy to add to an existing application while maintaining a high level of security.

= Currently Implemented = 
  # simple auth server based on a radius approach with a web managment interface
  # GA4PHP class which provides a simple interface and simple data management
  # lots of example provided for ways of provisioning users in various backends
  # Can support non-google authenticators where the key is provided in some format that leads to hex
  # moved from IPC comms to TCP comms for authd/authserver


= Current Problems = 
  # GA4PHP class needs exceptions
  # auth server is serial - i.e. one auth request at a time thanks to single IPC pipe (or the way i manage it)
  # generating QRcodes - currently only really works on linux based stuff and uses the qrencode binary
  # many possible lock-up scenarios in the authserver/authclient relationship
  # current authserver is a code mess
  # would love to see people actually using it for something interesting


= Upcoming Features =
  # the no 1 feature im going to work on now is making the auth server installable via the script
  # enumerate the errors from ga4php class and authclient
  # syslog for authd
  # re-write the authd/authclient from scratch in a non-braindead way
  # add a soap connector for auth/authclient
  # forcing ssl
  # QRCode generator entirely in PHP (yeah right...)
  # mOTP
  # third party auth? i.e. website one is the auth provider for website 2 as a service
  # integration plugins for some common applications (mediawiki, drupal, wordpress..)
