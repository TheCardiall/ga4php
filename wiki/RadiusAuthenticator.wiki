The radius authenticator exists in the subdirectory "authserver". It'll have a couple of goals:

 * connect to various backends for auth (i.e. AD, ldap, etc)
 * use multiple storage types (sqlite, mysql, ldap, ad)
 * allow for user based provisioning (self-provisioning)
 * simple deployment


What it will do day one:

 * simple web interface for provisioning users
 * simple web interface that takes over freeradius config
 * one-time url for users to get their tokens from
 * ability to add non-ga tokens (i.e. direct string input)
 * simple script that downloads (via apt-get) required components and gets gaas via svn for installation.
 * provide a radius server (Freeradius) to authenticate against (only passcodes)
